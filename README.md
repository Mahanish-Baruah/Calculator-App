## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- JavaScipt

### What I learned

The keypad was a good practice for CSS Grid. Also some good javascript DOM manipulation practice. The toggle button was a pain in the ass to build. In the end I just used CSS Grid for it.

### Useful resources

- [Learn CSS Grid - A 13 Minute Deep Dive](https://youtu.be/EiNiSFIPIQE?si=Hcvey1jSVucgf0zy) - This helped me finally understand CSS Grids. Really neat video.
